# Favorite-Comic-NLP
An attempt to do natural language processing. 
Inspired by https://github.com/adashofdata/nlp-in-python-tutorial

# # Motivation
NLP is how to deal with data. 

Data Science Workflow:
    Start with a question
    Get & clean the data
    Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
    Apply Techniques
    Share Insights

Corpus is a collection of texts.
Document Term Matrix - iNvolves cleaning data (remove punctuations make all text lowercase and remove numbers), 
                       tokenize data (break into smaller parts a sentence can be broken into words and remove the stop words)
                       put it into a matrix (count vectorizer in skikit learn is a good tool for DTM)

Data Anlysis involves
    Programming
    Math and Stats
    Communication
